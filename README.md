## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to generate synthetic chest X-ray images to augment real medical datasets. The project consists of two main components:

- **Baseline GAN Approach:**  
  A Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) is implemented to generate 256×256 synthetic chest X-ray images. This baseline is evaluated using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS).

- **Core Diffusion Model (DDPM) Approach:**  
  A lightweight Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) pre-trained on CIFAR-10 (`google/ddpm-cifar10-32`) is adopted and fine-tuned its UNet on the chest X-ray dataset. The diffusion model works by first corrupting an image with Gaussian noise (forward process) and then learning to reverse this process (reverse diffusion) to generate synthetic images from pure noise.

The ultimate goal is to evaluate how the augmented synthetic dataset affects the performance of downstream classification tasks.

## 3. Environment Setup and Dependencies

### Environment Requirements
- **Python:** 3.8 or higher
- **PyTorch:** Latest stable version (with CUDA support)
- **Torchvision**
- **Diffusers:** Hugging Face Diffusers library
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Pillow**

### Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shriyachepur/Synthetic-Medical-Data-Generation
   

## Data Preparation
The dataset is a subsection of the NIH Chest X-ray collection. It includes images labeled with either ”infiltration” or ”no finding,” representing two diagnostic categories. The
subset consists of approximately 40,000 images around 20,000 instances for each class, ensuring a class balance.

### Dataset Download and Subset Extraction

- The full NIH Chest X-ray dataset is to be downloaded from the official source (e.g., [NIH Chest X-ray Dataset](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC)).  

### Data Extraction Process

- A script named `data_extraction.py` is provided for extracting a relevant subset of the dataset.  
- The CSV file (`final_data.csv`) containing image labels is used by the script to filter the full dataset.  
- A balanced subset, containing images corresponding to the labels “infiltration” and “no_finding”, is generated and organized into three splits: training, validation, and test.

### Running the Extraction Script

- The extraction script is to be executed from the project root. An example command is shown below:
  ```bash
  python data_extraction.py

## Training and Testing

### Training

- The GAN baseline model was trained using `gan.ipynb`.  
  - Training was performed over 20 epochs with adversarial updates applied to both the generator and the discriminator.  
  - Checkpoint model and sample images were saved after each epoch in the `models/` and `results/baseline_results/` directories, respectively.

- The diffusion model (DDPM) was fine-tuned using the script `ddpm.ipynb`.  
  - Chest X-ray images were first resized to 32×32 pixels (to match the pre-trained model input) and normalized to the range [-1, 1].  
  - For each training batch, a random timestep was sampled and Gaussian noise was added according to the forward diffusion process.  
  - The UNet was fine-tuned by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted noise and the actual noise.  
  - The AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1×10⁻⁵ was used to update the UNet parameters.  
  - The fine-tuned model was saved in `models/fine_tuned_ddpm_unet.pth`.
